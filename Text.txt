It is too dark to read

What to use it with?

You light a match and light the candle with it

$ READ SCROLL

"You might have lost the way and goal
The way to know is to see all whole

To grow in meaningful extent
Read out the spell below's content

WALK through the opening in space
take your time, it's not a race"

There is a SPELL attached to the scroll.

As you read out the magic spell, a PORTAL made out of energy opens.

You trip. You fall. You realize that you are wearing roller blades. You cannot walk. You can only ROLL.

You roll through the portal.

Or does the portal roll through you? Or is it the room that rolls through the portal? Or does the portal you through the roll on the room... ...

"You are a closer match to clarity
Lack of attention your only enemy

PLAY with the shadow of the light
Revive this tale when the time is right:

The freeest monarch of the wind pounced,
at a double-quad-limbed creep,
whilst your best friend's ancestors sing."

$ PLAY SCROLL

You play with the scroll but it is neither fun nor productive.

$ PLAY CANDLE

You can produce the following shadow puppets: WOLF, ELK, EAGLE, SPIDER, GOOSE

The light burns brighter. THIS WAS THE CORRECT CHOICE.

$ [FINAL CORRECT CHOICE]

As you play out the magic sequence, the room turns light and heat into a PORTAL.
